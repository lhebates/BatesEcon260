# Google Colab Setup — Intermediate Microeconomics

Welcome to the Colab setup guide for Intermediate Microeconomics. Follow these short, numbered steps to open the first notebook from the course GitHub repository.

## Step 1 — Sign in to Google Colab (Important)

1. Open https://colab.research.google.com/ in your browser.  
2. If prompted, sign in using your *college* Google account.  
   - Important: Do not use a personal account. If you are already signed into a personal account, click your avatar and choose "Add another account" or "Switch account."

## Step 2 — Open a notebook from GitHub

1. On Colab's homepage click File → Open notebook (or use the "Open notebook" dialog if it appears automatically).  
2. Select the **GitHub** tab.  
3. In the search box type the repository name: `lhebates/BatesEcon260` and press Enter.  
4. Click the repository name when it appears, then scroll down to see the class notebooks (`.ipynb` files).
5. Click `0.1 Intro to Jupyter Notebook.ipynb` to open it.

## Step 3 — Edit and Run

## Run your first code cell

- Notebooks contain code and text cells. Click the play button (triangle) to the left of a code cell to run it, or click inside the cell and press Shift + Enter.  
- The first run may take a few seconds while Colab connects and initializes a runtime. Wait for the "Connected" indicator.

## Editing text cells

- To edit a text (Markdown) cell: double-click the cell or select it and press Enter — the cell will enter edit mode.  
- Make changes using Markdown or the editor toolbar (bold, links, lists, etc.).  
- To render/preview your changes: press Shift + Enter or click the play/run button at the left of the cell.  
- To add a new text cell: click "+ Text" in the toolbar or use Insert → Text cell.  
- To change a cell between Code and Text: use the cell-type dropdown on the toolbar for the selected cell.  
- Other quick actions: drag the handle at the left of a cell to reorder; use Ctrl+Z (Cmd+Z on Mac) to undo while editing.

## Step 4 — Save a copy to your Google Drive (Essential)

- You are viewing the notebook directly from GitHub. To preserve edits, click File → Save a copy in Drive.
- A personal copy will open in a new tab and will be saved in your Google Drive (usually under "Colab Notebooks").

## Quick tips

- Shortcut to run a cell: Shift + Enter.  
- To restart the runtime: Runtime → Restart runtime.  
- If a cell needs internet access (e.g., reading from GitHub), ensure you allow any prompts Colab shows.

## Troubleshooting

- Notebook not found in GitHub tab: ensure the repository name is typed exactly `lhebates/BatesEcon260`.  
- Wrong Google account: switch accounts via your avatar in the top-right of the Colab page.  
- Runtime stuck on "Connecting": try refreshing the page, then Runtime → Restart runtime. If problems persist, check your network or try again later.

## Where to go next

- Open other notebooks in the `materials` folder in order (02, 03, ...).  
- If you run into persistent issues, contact the course TA or instructor with a brief description and a screenshot.
